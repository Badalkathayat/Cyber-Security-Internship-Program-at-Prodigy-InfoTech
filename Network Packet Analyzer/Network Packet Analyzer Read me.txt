Network Packet Analyzer

This is a simple yet powerful packet sniffer tool developed in Python. The tool captures and analyzes network packets, displaying relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data. This tool is intended for educational purposes only.

Features

- Captures live network packets.
- Displays source and destination IP addresses.
- Identifies and shows the protocol used (TCP, UDP, ICMP).
- Displays payload data for TCP and UDP packets.

Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `scapy` library

Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Badalkathayat/Network-Packet-Analyzer.git
   cd Network-Packet-Analyzer
   

2. Install the required library:

   bash
   pip install scapy
   

## Usage

1. Run the packet sniffer tool:

   bash
   sudo python packet_sniffer.py
   

   > **Note:** You might need to run the script with administrative privileges (e.g., using `sudo` on Linux) to capture packets.

2. The tool will start capturing packets and display information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data.

3. To stop the tool, press `Ctrl+C`.
